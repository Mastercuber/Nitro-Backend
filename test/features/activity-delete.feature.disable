Feature: Delete an object
  I want to delete objects

  Background:
    Given our own server runs at "http://localhost:4100"
    And we have the following users in our database:
      | Slug          |
      | bernd-das-brot|

  Scenario: Deleting a post (Article Object)
    When I send a POST request with the following activity to "/activitypub/users/bernd-das-brot/inbox":
    """
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "id": "https://localhost:4100/users/karl-heinz/status/a4DJ2afdg323v32641vna42lkj685kasd2",
      "type": "Delete",
      "object": {
          "id": "https://aronda.org/users/marvin/status/kljsdfg9843jknsdf",
          "type": "Article",
          "published": "2019-02-07T19:37:55.002Z",
          "attributedTo": "https://aronda.org/users/marvin",
          "content": "Hi John, how are you?",
          "to": "https://localhost:4100/activitypub/users/max"
      }
    }
    """
    Then I expect the status code to be 200
    And the object is removed from the outbox collection of "karl-heinz"
